Typical first User experience
---
* Login
* Create a blank map, i.e. location collection
* Add a location of interest
	* Search google api for a place you've been
	* Mark a location as visited
		* Create a comment on a location
* Search for locations nearby, or in areas, with keywords
	* See google results, alongside other MySpots users' locations
* Add some locations to your map, marked as unvisited
* save the map
* allow/disallow other users to see the map/collection
* logout

Next Use
---
* Decide to want to visit the locations in a particular collection
* login to app
* enter into 'using/visiting' mode on the map
* see overlapping times (gallery/cafe hourse) and distances and a recommended visiting order/itinerary
* Mark locations as visited, give +1/0/-1 rating
	* place a comment on a location
* Have a choice of whether to keep the location in the itinerary

Another Use Case
---
* Add another user as a friend, share your map
* The map you see will contain all info about locations that any users share
* Share the map with anyone who is not a user on the site
	* when you share, the links you give out are unique, in that they weight the sharer's opinions/comments more than other users' comments on the same locations
* Next, create more maps! Or expand current ones. Keep dates that you add/discover locations.
* See a newsfeed to do with your visited locations (user comments, updates to that location's website)
* Go onto a user's profile page, see the locations they like, and the location collections they've curated.

Overall, it would be centric to certain categories that are less stressed in other apps like yelp, such as galleries and cafes. Ultimately, I'd like to have category views where gallery names appear with the artists that they are showing (pulled from internet, but maybe with the gallery locations seeded/user contributed?), alongside bios and pictures of work pulled from wiki/google. As well as a cafe category that explicitly lists particular things about cafes like wifi/plug accessibility, noise level, cash-only, no-computer rule, seat quality, size estimateâ€¦ as user contributed.
